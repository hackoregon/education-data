## Abstract

Afterschool programs can serve low income kids, working to lower the achievement gap and level the playing field.  These programs are chronically under-funded in Oregon; low-income programs are often publicly funded and are unable to sustain themselves without this stream of funding.

We look at the effects of summer and afterschool programs on the English, Math, and Science performance of Oregon schools.  After controlling for the general effects of poverty, we find that presence of programs has a strong positive correlation with school performance.

## Summary

We compared the performance of a total of 993 schools across three subjects (English, Math, Science) and three school types (Elementary, Middle, and High Schools).  The key results are summarized below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# These commands generate a plot.  As they're all basically the same,
# we'll just go through this one and update when new methods are used.
# We first define the data set and assign variables to columns
g <- ggplot(data = agg, aes(x = Programs, y = value, group = 1))
# Next we plot a point for each class of school, colored by SchoolType
g <- g + geom_point(aes(color = SchoolType))
# We break the figure into three, one for each Subject
g <- g + facet_grid(. ~ Subject)
# Force symmetric axes
g <- g + ylim(-10, 10)
# Add x- and y-axis labels and a title
g <- g + ylab("Performance Relative to Expectations (%)")
g <- g + xlab("Number of Programs")
g <- g + ggtitle("Performance by School Type and Subject, 2014-15")
g
```

The diagram above shows that for each of the three subjects, the average performance of a given school type (e.g. Elementary) is higher for the schools that have afterschool and summer programs.

There are several caveats that must be acknowledged along with this analysis:

 * We do not have complete data on the majority of the over 5000 schools in Oregon
 * We have much more data on elementary schools than on middle or high schools
 * Most of the schools with complete data also host programs

## Methodology

First, we describe the data analyzed in this report.  We start by combining enrollment, free or reduced lunch eligibility (FRLE), and standardized test performance on the schools for which complete data exists.  Using FRLE rates as a metric of poverty, we first model the effect of poverty on school performance so that we may focus instead on the effect of afterschool programs.

In the following charts, we show the percent of students that met or exceeded the standard in a subject (English, Math, Science) as a function of the FRLE rate.  The size of each dot reflects the school's enrollment, and the color reflects its grade level.  We have also added lines of best fit.

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(overall, aes(x = PercentEligible, y = Eng_Met))
# Alpha affects the points' opacity; we also size each dot by Enrollment
p <- p + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, aes(size = Enrollment, color = SchoolType))
# We want size to scale with area, so that a school twice as big look so
p <- p + scale_size_area()
p <- p + xlim(0, 100) + ylim(0, 100)
# We add lines of best fit, one for each SchoolType
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, aes(color = SchoolType))
p <- p + xlab("Students Eligible for Free/Reduced Lunches (%)")
p <- p + ylab("Met/Exceeded English Proficiency (%)")
p <- p + ggtitle("English Proficiency v Free/Reduced Lunch Eligibility, 2014-15")
p
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(overall, aes(x = PercentEligible, y = Math_Met))
p <- p + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, aes(size = Enrollment, color = SchoolType))
p <- p + scale_size_area()
p <- p + xlim(0, 100) + ylim(0, 100)
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, aes(color = SchoolType))
p <- p + xlab("Students Eligible for Free/Reduced Lunches (%)")
p <- p + ylab("Met/Exceeded Math Proficiency (%)")
p <- p + ggtitle("Math Proficiency v Free/Reduced Lunch Eligibility, 2014-15")
p
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(overall, aes(x = PercentEligible, y = Sci_Met))
p <- p + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, aes(size = Enrollment, color = SchoolType))
p <- p + scale_size_area()
p <- p + xlim(0, 100) + ylim(0, 100)
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, aes(color = SchoolType))
p <- p + xlab("Students Eligible for Free/Reduced Lunches (%)")
p <- p + ylab("Met/Exceeded Science Proficiency (%)")
p <- p + ggtitle("Science Proficiency v Free/Reduced Lunch Eligibility, 2014-15")
p
```

To focus on the effect of afterschool programs, we compute the difference between a school's percentage of students that meet or exceed the standard in each subject and the expected percentage based on FRLE rate.  The result is a residual performance rating for each school, where a rating of 3 would suggest that the school exceeded its expected performance in a subject by 3 percentage points.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# To give a fuller picture of the distribution of the residual performance 
# data, we use box-and-whisker plots.
p <- ggplot(overall, aes(x = SchoolType, y = ResEng))
# Make box-and-whisker plots, coloring the boxes by existance of Programming
p <- p + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Programs))
# Override the default color choices
p <- p + scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green"))
p <- p + xlab("Grade Level")
p <- p + ylab("Residual English Proficiency (%)")
p <- p + ggtitle("Residual English Proficiency v Programs Held, 2014-15")
p
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(overall, aes(x = SchoolType, y = ResMath))
p <- p + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Programs))
p <- p + scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green"))
p <- p + xlab("Grade Level")
p <- p + ylab("Residual Math Proficiency (%)")
p <- p + ggtitle("Residual Math Proficiency v Programs Held, 2014-15")
p
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(overall, aes(x = SchoolType, y = ResSci))
p <- p + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Programs))
p <- p + scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green"))
p <- p + xlab("Grade Level")
p <- p + ylab("Residual Science Proficiency (%)")
p <- p + ggtitle("Residual Science Proficiency v Programs Held, 2014-15")
p
